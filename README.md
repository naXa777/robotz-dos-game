# robotz-dos-game
Robotz is a computer game that was developed for the DOS operating system. In this turn-based game, players are tasked with escaping from robots programmed to pursue and kill them.  
It's a derivative version from [robots computer game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_(computer_game)). 

## Gameplay
Robotz is played on a two-dimensional rectangular grid. The objective of the game is to escape from a number of robots, which have been programmed with only a single objective: to kill the player.

The game is turn-based. The robots start at randomly selected locations on the grid. Every time the player character moves a square in any direction (horizontally, vertically), each robot moves one square closer to him, in whichever direction is the shortest way.

If the player character collides with a robot, he dies and the game ends. However, the robots are also fatal to each other - when two robots collide, they both die.

When all robots on a level are dead, the player moves onto another level, with more robots. Traditionally, the number of robots increases each level.
